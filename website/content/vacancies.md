# Open positions

We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit! 

#### PhD and Postdoc positions

If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send me an [email](mailto:leo.lahti@iki.fi). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ or _"Application Postdoc"_ in the subject line.

There are some postdoc scholarships available.  I'd be happy to support you after you apply to our group. Take a look at the [Marie Curie fellowship](http://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/about-msca/actions/if/index_en.htm).
