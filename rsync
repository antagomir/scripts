rsync -abviuzP src/ dest/

    -i turns on the itemized format, which shows more information than the default format
    -b makes rsync backup files that exist in both folders, appending ~ to the old file. You can control this suffix with --suffix .suf
    -u makes rsync transfer skip files which are newer in dest than in src
    -z turns on compression, which is useful when transferring easily-compressible files over slow links
    -P turns on --partial and --progress
    --partial makes rsync keep partially transferred files if the transfer is interrupted
    --progress shows a progress bar for each transfer, useful if you transfer big files
